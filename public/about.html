<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Tiffany, a third culture kid born in the US to Malaysian parents and brought up in China. I am currently based in Singapore, working as a Product Manager at SPH Media.</p>

<p>I graduated from The University of Hong Kong in 2017 with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration majoring in Business Design & Innovation with a minor in Sociology. During my university years, I completed summer internships at Maxus Global Media and Citibank. After graduation, I joined Lenovo as a Consumer Product Manager as part of their inaugural Global Future Leaders Program, a management trainee program for high potential hires. </p>

<p>After a good 3 years at Lenovo, I decided to relocate from Hong Kong to Singapore in order to be closer to family. Hence, I joined Shopee as a Country Product Manager managing the coordination work between local country teams at Mexico and Philippines and the global headquarters in Singapore. Shortly after, I joined LingoAce, a high growth education technology startup as a Product Manager managing the SEA region. After a good 2 years at LingoAce, I joined SPH Media, my current company, as a Product Manager for the Chinese Media Group, which includes digital media products such as Zaobao, ThinkChina, Redants and so on.
